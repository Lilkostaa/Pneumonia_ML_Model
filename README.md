## üéØ Overview

This project aims to automatically detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model employs Transfer Learning with VGG16 as the base architecture, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia-affected lungs.

**Key Features:**
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained VGG16
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Multiple evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)
- Automated training with callbacks (Early Stopping, Learning Rate Reduction)
- Visualization of training history

## üìä Dataset

### Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) by Paul Mooney.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset contains **5,863 chest X-ray images** (JPEG) organized into 3 folders:
- **Train**: 5,216 images
- **Test**: 624 images  
- **Validation**: 16 images

Each folder contains two subdirectories:
- `NORMAL`: X-rays from healthy patients
- `PNEUMONIA`: X-rays from patients with pneumonia

### Dataset Statistics
- Training set: 74% pneumonia, 26% normal
- Test set: 62% pneumonia, 38% normal
- Validation set: 50% pneumonia, 50% normal

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Kaggle API credentials

### Python Libraries
tensorflow>=2.10.0
kagglehub
numpy
matplotlib

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/LilKostaa/Pneumonia_ML_Model.git
cd Pneumonia_ML_Model

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

### Step 3: Set Up Kaggle API

To download the dataset, you need to configure Kaggle API credentials:

1. **Create a Kaggle Account**: Sign up at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)

2. **Generate API Token**:
   - Go to your [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
   - Scroll to the **API** section
   - Click **"Create New API Token"**
   - This will download a `kaggle.json` file

3. **Place the API Token**:
   - **Linux/Mac**: Move `kaggle.json` to `~/.kaggle/`
   - **Windows**: Move to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\`
   

## üíª Usage

### 1. Download Dataset

Run the `DownloadDataSet.py` script to download the chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle:

**What it does:**
- Authenticates with Kaggle API using your credentials
- Downloads the latest version of the chest X-ray pneumonia dataset
- Prints the local path where the dataset is stored
- The dataset will be cached locally for future use

**Output:**
Path to dataset files: /path/to/.cache/kagglehub/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/...

### 2. Train the Model
Run the `TrainingModel.py` script to train the pneumonia detection model:

**What it does:**
- Downloads the dataset (if not already downloaded)
- Loads and preprocesses the images with data augmentation
- Builds a CNN model using VGG16 Transfer Learning
- Trains the model for 25 epochs with callbacks
- Saves the best model as `best_pneumonia_model.h5`
- Saves the final model as `pneumonia_detection_model.h5`
- Evaluates performance on the test set
- Generates training history visualization

**Training Process:**
1. **Data Loading**: Images are loaded and split into batches
2. **Data Augmentation**: Training images undergo rotation, shifting, zoom, and flipping
3. **Model Training**: VGG16-based model trains with early stopping
4. **Model Evaluation**: Test set metrics are computed
5. **Visualization**: Training/validation curves are saved

**Expected Output:**
Classes found: {'NORMAL': 0, 'PNEUMONIA': 1}
Training images: 5216
Validation images: 16
Test images: 624
